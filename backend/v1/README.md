# Greenhouse Companion

## Project Overview

Greenhouse Companion is a comprehensive web application developed as a culminating project at Holberton School. This versatile web app serves as a virtual garden assistant, enhancing the gardening experience through a range of functionalities. The user-friendly dashboard features diverse modules tailored to different aspects of gardening and plant management.

## Technologies Used

Greenhouse Companion leverages a variety of technologies to achieve its functionalities:

- RESTful API: Built with Python and Flask to enable seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.
- Microprocessors (ESP boards): Programmed in C++ to gather sensor data, including air temperature, humidity, soil temperature, and soil humidity. These sensors communicate data via WiFi.
- Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for data retrieval from the REST API and potential animations.
- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code on Mac OS X provides a robust environment for creating the application.

## Dashboard Modules

1. **Plant Manager**: This module allows users to manage their plant database using an intuitive HTML form. The module interacts with a backend powered by a RESTful API, facilitating CRUD operations for effective plant record management.

2. **Forecast**: The Forecast module retrieves real-time weather data from an external API. This feature keeps users informed about weather conditions, aiding in planning gardening activities.

3. **To-Do List**: The To-Do List, assisting users in efficiently organizing tasks alongside plant care. The module interacts with a backend powered by a RESTful API, facilitating CRUD operations for effective plant record management.

4. **Sensor Data Display**: The Sensor Data module retrieves information from MySQL databases and visualizes the data in various formats, helping users understand their garden's well-being.

5. **Garden Advice by ChatGPT**: This module integrates ChatGPT to provide expert insights and personalized garden advice based on user queries, adding dynamic interactivity to the gardening experience.

## Additional Sections

Beyond the dashboard modules, Greenhouse Companion offers:

- **Vegetable Production Visualization**: JavaScript is employed to fetch and display vegetable production data from the REST API, assisting users in tracking their gardening progress.
- **Sensor Data Charts**: JavaScript-powered charts visually represent sensor data retrieved from the MySQL database, aiding data comprehension and decision-making.
- **Plant Encyclopedia and Gardening Tips**: This segment acts as a comprehensive repository of plant information and gardening tips, enhancing users' gardening knowledge and skills.

## Achieving Curriculum Goals

Central to this project is the aspiration to consolidate the learnings from the first year of studying at Holberton School. By intentionally integrating the technologies explored throughout the year, Greenhouse Companion showcases the ability to utilize these tools to create a practical solution that addresses personal gardening needs and potentially resonates with others who share a passion for gardening.
